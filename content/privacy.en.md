## Data controller
This website is operated by **Manuel Martín Salvador**.

For privacy-related requests, please use the [contact page](/en/contact/) (or email using the address provided there).

## What data is collected
This website is primarily informational. Personal data is only collected when you explicitly provide it.

This may happen in these cases:

- **Email contact**: if you send an email, the data you include will be processed (e.g., your email address and message contents).
- **Scheduling a call (Cal.com)**: if you use the booking button on the contact page, a third-party service (Cal.com) is loaded to display availability and manage the booking.

In addition, like most websites, infrastructure providers may process **technical data** (e.g., IP address, user-agent, timestamps and access logs) for security, maintenance, and content delivery.

## Purposes
Your data may be processed to:

- **Respond to requests** you make (via email or a call booking).
- **Provide the requested service** (e.g., scheduling a call).
- **Maintain security and basic operation** of the website.

## Legal basis
Depending on the context, the legal basis may be:

- **Your consent**, when you contact or initiate a booking.
- **Legitimate interests**, for security and basic operational needs.

## Third parties
This website relies on third-party providers:

- **GitHub Pages** (hosting and content delivery).
- **Google Fonts** (fonts loaded from Google-owned domains). In the checks performed for this website, Google Fonts did not set cookies, but it does involve requests to third-party domains.
- **Cal.com** (only when you interact with the booking widget). Cal.com may set cookies on its own domain to operate the widget.

This website also links to external services (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, Scholar, Mastodon). When you visit them, their own policies apply.

## Retention
- **Emails and communications**: for as long as needed to handle your request and keep a reasonable professional record.
- **Technical data/logs** (if applicable): according to the provider’s standard retention periods for security and diagnostics.

## Your rights
You can request access, rectification, deletion, objection, restriction, and portability (where applicable) via the [contact page](/en/contact/).

## Cookies
This website does not use first-party cookies for its main content. However, some third-party services (e.g., Cal.com when opening the booking widget) may use cookies.

See the [Cookie Policy](/en/cookies/) for details.
