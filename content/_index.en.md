<h2>What I do</h2>
<p class="landing-lead">I help companies and R&D teams design, build, and deploy computer vision & AI systems, with a focus on reliability, metrics, and cost.</p>

<div class="landing-grid">
<div class="landing-card">
<h3>If you’re dealing with…</h3>
<ul class="landing-list">
<li>A pilot that “works” but fails on real-world data and edge cases.</li>
<li>Feasibility uncertainty: data, metrics, latency, cost, privacy.</li>
<li>Needing an external review of architecture, performance, or dataset quality.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="landing-card">
<h3>I can help you get…</h3>
<ul class="landing-list">
<li>A clear plan: what to do first, what to measure, and key risks.</li>
<li>Reproducible results (not fragile demos) and data-driven decisions.</li>
<li>Practical handover: documentation, next steps, and technical support.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p>Background: PhD in ML, 15+ years bridging research and industry, and hands-on CV experience (face detection, monocular 3D eye estimation, hand tracking). <a href="/en/about/">More about me</a>.</p>

<h2>How we’ll work together</h2>
<p class="landing-lead">A simple process to quickly reduce uncertainty and move toward the right solution.</p>
</div>

<div class="landing-steps">
<div class="landing-step">
<div class="landing-step__number">1</div>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>We define the goal, success metrics, available data, and constraints (latency, cost, environment, privacy).</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> feasibility assessment + action plan.</p>
</div>

<div class="landing-step">
<div class="landing-step__number">2</div>
<h3>Prototype & evaluation</h3>
<p>We build a baseline, iterate with reproducible experiments, and validate on your data.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> clear metrics + effort, cost, and risk estimates.</p>
</div>

<div class="landing-step">
<div class="landing-step__number">3</div>
<h3>Production & handover</h3>
<p>We land the architecture, MLOps, and monitoring. I make the system easy to maintain and scale.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> technical deliverables + handover + targeted support.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<div class="landing-faq">
<details>
<summary>What kind of projects are the best fit?</summary>
<p>Computer vision and AI systems where reliability matters: feasibility, evaluation, architecture, performance, and bridging the gap from prototype to production.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What do you need to get started?</summary>
<p>A short description of the goal, sample data (even a small subset), how to measure success, and constraints (latency, cost, privacy). If you don’t have data yet, we can define a capture/labeling plan.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you work hourly or project-based?</summary>
<p>Both. We can start with a small hourly block for discovery, or define a project with clear scope and deliverables.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can you sign an NDA?</summary>
<p>Yes. I’ve worked with teams with strict confidentiality requirements.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you communicate?</summary>
<p>I adapt to your team: async when possible (for focus), short meetings when useful. I work in CET/CEST.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What tools do you use?</summary>
<p>I mainly work with Python, PyTorch, and MLflow for experiment tracking/monitoring. I’m not tied to a specific cloud provider, and I can adapt to your environment (AWS, GCP, Azure, or on‑prem).</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you issue invoices?</summary>
<p>Yes. I’m registered as a self‑employed professional in Spain and can issue invoices.</p>
