## Background

I hold a PhD in Machine Learning from Bournemouth University and a Master's in Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems from the University of Granada. My research focused on <i>AutoML</i>, <i>data-stream mining</i> and <i>adaptive learning</i>, always at the intersection of theory and real-world application.

## Current Work

At [Blink](https://blinkeye.com), I develop deep learning systems for face detection, monocular 3D eye estimation, and others. This work demands precision at every stage: data collection, model architecture, evaluation metrics, and deployment optimization.

## Working Style

I'm a researcher by training and an engineer by practice. I value clarity over cleverness, reproducibility over novelty, and solutions that have a real impact. My experience spans the full AI lifecycle: from designing experiments, writing code to model deployment.

I've worked remotely for international teams for over 7 years. I communicate proactively, detect problems early, and deliver on commitments. I'm comfortable discussing machine learning foundations with researchers as well as communicating with final clients.
