## Current Work

I work as a **freelance consultant** and part-time at [Blink](https://blinkeye.com), where I develop **deep learning** systems for solving **computer vision** challenges such as face detection, monocular 3D eye estimation and hand tracking. This work demands precision at every stage: data collection, model architecture, evaluation metrics, and deployment optimization.

## Working Style

I lie in the intersection between research and software engineering. I value **clarity** over cleverness, **reliability** over novelty, and solutions that have a **real impact**. My experience spans the full AI lifecycle: from designing experiments, writing code to model deployment.

I've worked remotely for **international** teams for over 7 years. I communicate proactively, detect problems early, and deliver on commitments. I'm comfortable discussing machine learning foundations with researchers as well as communicating with final clients.

## Professional Accreditation

I am a member of [CPITIA](https://www.cpitia.org) (Professional Association of Technical Engineers in Computer Science of Andalusia) with membership number **20250131-A**. I follow a [code of ethics](https://www.cpitia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Deontolog%C3%ADa-CPITIA.pdf) that ensures ethical and responsible professional practice. Additionally, I hold **Professional Liability Insurance** to protect my clients.


## Background

I hold a PhD in Machine Learning from Bournemouth University and a Master's in Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems from the University of Granada. My research focused on <i>AutoML</i>, <i>data-stream mining</i> and <i>adaptive learning</i>, always at the intersection of theory and real-world application.

I'm continuously learning through courses, attending conferences, and reading books to stay current with the latest trends and advances in AI and machine learning.
